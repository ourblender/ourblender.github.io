Permissionless blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum unfortunately are not private. The best you get is pseudonymity, which is not equivalent to anonymity. Many existing privacy solutions have been proposed, and they could be divided into two types of solutions:
&amp;ldquo;Add-on privacy&amp;rdquo; for non-private blockchains. Real-world examples are Tornado Cash, Zether, etc. &amp;ldquo;Private-by-design&amp;rdquo; blockchains, e.g. Monero, ZCash, etc. Add-on privacy solutions have the advantage of being surrounded by a significant userbase on their underlying blockchain.</description></item></channel></rss>
