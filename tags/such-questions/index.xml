Blender is a privacy-enhancing pool, in which you deposit from one Ethereum address, and you withdraw out to another address. The link between your deposit and withdraw address can therefore be hidden. You can only use fixed sized amounts for deposit, and you can only withdraw the same amount you deposited. The technology behind this is based on zk-SNARKS. Your privacy, or anonymity depends on how many different users deposit in the pool.</description></item></channel></rss>
