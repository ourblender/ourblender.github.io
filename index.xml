The pool sizes will probably remain below the sizes of lending/borrowing and exchange protocols, yet its hard to estimate their resulting sizes.
By observing Tornado Cash&amp;rsquo;s contracts, you can see that the 100 ETH pool amounted at an all-time-high to about 6 million USD. One way to put those dormant funds to work, is to use a lending platform.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>/posts/faq/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 12:42:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/faq/</guid><description>How does Blender work? Blender is a privacy-enhancing pool, in which you deposit from one Ethereum address, and you withdraw out to another address. The link between your deposit and withdraw address can therefore be hidden. You can only use fixed sized amounts for deposit, and you can only withdraw the same amount you deposited. The technology behind this is based on zk-SNARKS. Your privacy, or anonymity depends on how many different users deposit in the pool.</description></item><item><title>Privacy - What to look out for</title><link>/posts/privacy-and-what-to-look-out-for/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 12:42:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/privacy-and-what-to-look-out-for/</guid><description>Whenever you use your computer, mobile phone or tablet, you are leaking information. Many people have already warned us about global surveillance by state actors, and are risking their lives for us. Online business models are publicly known to track meticiously their users, as a means of generating revenue.
This is by no means meant to be an exhaustive guide on how to protect your privacy, as its preferrable for you to find extensive resources that have done so very well.</description></item><item><title>Token Economics</title><link>/posts/token-economics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2020 12:42:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/token-economics/</guid><description>Why a token? A token has two primary purposes in Blender: (i) to decentralise the governance process, and (ii) to attract non-privacy aware users. By attracting different user demographics (namely privacy-sensitive users, and users interested in the token), the anonymity set of the mixer is likely to experience a more diverse and bigger set of users. This will then hopefully improve the privacy of all involved users, and hence provide a strong utility to the entire Ethereum ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>A Primer on Blender</title><link>/posts/a-primer-on-blnd/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 12:42:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/posts/a-primer-on-blnd/</guid><description>Privacy matters. Permissionless blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum unfortunately are not private. The best you get is pseudonymity, which is not equivalent to anonymity. Many existing privacy solutions have been proposed, and they could be divided into two types of solutions:
&amp;ldquo;Add-on privacy&amp;rdquo; for non-private blockchains. Real-world examples are Tornado Cash, Zether, etc. &amp;ldquo;Private-by-design&amp;rdquo; blockchains, e.g. Monero, ZCash, etc. Add-on privacy solutions have the advantage of being surrounded by a significant userbase on their underlying blockchain.</description></item></channel></rss>
