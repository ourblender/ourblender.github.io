The link between your deposit and withdraw address can therefore be hidden. You can only use fixed sized amounts for deposit, and you can only withdraw the same amount you deposited. The technology behind this is based on zk-SNARKS. Your privacy, or anonymity depends on how many different users deposit in the pool.</p><p>In addition to offering privacy, Blender deposits your ETH into Aave for you to earn an interest rate. In addition to the interests, if you keep a deposit in Blender for at least <code>5</code> days (36&rsquo;000 blocks), you&rsquo;re eligible to receive a <code>BLND</code> token reward before issuing a withdraw. To be able to farm, there needs to happen <em>at least one deposit</em> in your pool on the 5th day of your deposit age.</p><h2 id=where-is-the-code>Where is the code?</h2><p>Blender&rsquo;s code is open source on Github: <a href=https://github.com/ourblender/ourblender.github.io>https://github.com/ourblender/ourblender.github.io</a></p><h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-use-blender>How much does it cost to use Blender?</h2><ul><li>Deposit: ~885k Gas</li><li>Withdrawal: ~385k Gas</li><li>BLND Farming: ~335k Gas</li></ul><h2 id=how-fast-can-i-generate-the-zk-snark-proof>How fast can I generate the zk-SNARK proof?</h2><p>Proof generation times measured on standard hardware:</p><ul><li>Withdraw: 5 seconds</li><li>Farming: 2.5 seconds</li></ul><h2 id=how-did-you-do-the-trusted-setup>How did you do the trusted setup?</h2><p>The trusted setup is planned to be repeated in a decentralized fashion, similar to how Tornado Cash has beautifully shown how it&rsquo;s done.</p><h2 id=what-is-an-anonymity-set>What is an anonymity set?</h2><p>An anonymity set is a number of other addresses, or users, from which a withdrawal could originate from. If there are 999 other addresses that deposited, and you have 1 deposit from your address in Blender, the anonymity set size is 1000. That means that if you withdraw your coins, then an external observer would have to guess with a probability of 1/1000 to find your address (ignoring other side channels).</p><h2 id=what-is-a-relayer-and-why-should-i-use-it>What is a relayer and why should I use it?</h2><p>To withdraw, or farm, you need to pay gas. The gas you pay should <strong>not</strong> be coming from your deposit address, otherwise an external observer can link your deposit to your withdrawal address. Hence you can ask a relayer to pay for your gas. A relayer can be used for both the withdrawal and your redeem transaction.</p><p>Please help and extend Blender with a relayer for other users. Feel free to reach out in the <a href=https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAFg3cEF0lTg4RXP6FA>Telegram group</a> for any questions, and you can create a DAO proposal to become a relayer and be incentivised by the DAO.</p><h2 id=how-is-blender-different-from-tornado-cash>How is Blender different from Tornado Cash?</h2><p>Blender was inspired by Tornado Cash and is a fork. There are three notable changes:</p><ol><li>Blender deposits user assets into Aave to yield interests while mixing.</li><li>Blender reduces the gas costs by using the Poseidon hash function.</li><li>Blender introduces a governance token <code>BLND</code> to incentivise participants to deposit and govern the system.</li></ol><h2 id=how-can-i-get-blnd-tokens>How can I get <code>BLND</code> tokens?</h2><p>The preferred way to earn <code>BLND</code> tokens, is by depositing coins into a pool and keep them in there for at least 5 days (36&rsquo;000 Blocks). The you can farm <code>BLND</code> tokens with your Blender note, and then you can withdraw your deposit. If you don&rsquo;t want to deposit into Blender, you can also likely purchase <code>BLND</code> tokens on your favorite DEX. The community, however, encourages you to participate in Blender to improve everyone&rsquo;s privacy.</p><h2 id=why-do-i-have-to-keep-eth-in-the-pool-for-5-days-to-farm>Why do I have to keep ETH in the pool for 5 days to farm?</h2><p>This incentivises users to keep coins longer within Blender and should help to increase the privacy properties of Blender. A user can chose to withdraw the deposited coins earlier, at the loss of not being able to redeem <code>BLND</code> tokens.</p><h2 id=why-can-i-only-farm-if-on-the-5th-day-of-my-deposit-age-there-is-another-deposit>Why can I only farm if on the 5th day of my deposit age there is another deposit?</h2><p>That is due to the way the Merkle Tree updates operate in Blender.</p><h2 id=can-an-external-observer-link-my-withdraw-and-farm-transactions>Can an external observer link my withdraw and farm transactions?</h2><p>Yes, at the moment they are linkable.</p><h2 id=how-many-blnd-tokens-can-i-get>How many <code>BLND</code> tokens can I get?</h2><p>Please check out the <a href=/posts/token-economics/>token economics</a>.</p><h2 id=does-blender-suffer-from-front-running-attacks>Does Blender suffer from front-running attacks?</h2><p>The Blender contract stores a list of 100 recent Merkle roots, and should therefore be resilient to front-running attacks. Note that a front-running attack can only provoke a transaction fail, not a loss of funds.</p><h2 id=how-many-deposits-does-blender-support-per-pool>How many deposits does Blender support per pool?</h2><p>The Merkle tree of Blender has a height of 20, and therefore supports 2^20=1&rsquo;048&rsquo;576 deposits per pool. Once a pool is exhausted, the DAO can vote on a successor pool to follow.</p><h2 id=what-are-my-risks>What are my risks?</h2><p>The following is a possibly incomplete list of security risks of using Blender:</p><ul><li>Smart contract vulnerability risks.</li><li>Governance token voting risk (someone amasses the majority of tokens).</li><li>Aave liquidation risks of lent out assets.</li><li>Currency value fluctuation of ETH.</li></ul><p>A possible incomplete list of privacy risks of using Blender:</p><ul><li>Network layer based deanonymization (IP addresses, etc)</li><li>Privacy violating RPC endpoints, e.g. through Infura. The community recommends to deploy your own full Ethereum node and point your wallet towards that node.</li><li>Compromised Blender website (you can download the code and run locally)</li><li>Browser fingerprinting</li><li>Hostile browser plugins/extensions</li><li>Malicious relayers exploiting some or all of the above</li></ul><h2 id=isnt-depositing-the-eth-into-aave-a-privacy-risk>Isn&rsquo;t depositing the ETH into Aave a privacy risk?</h2><p>The collective ETH within a pool is deposited into Aave from one account, the pool contract address. The longer coins are deposited, and not withdrawn, the more interests accrue. Note that depositing 1 ETH, always creates 1 aETH. When someone withdraws, the withdrawal receives the proportional interests accrued in the pool <em>collectively</em> - these are counted from the first deposit that occured into Aave, not necessarily since the first deposit of the user withdrawing. Therefore it&rsquo;s unlikely that this causes additional privacy risks.</p><h2 id=can-i-transfer-my-deposited-coins>Can I transfer my deposited coins?</h2><p>No, only deposit and withdraw.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=tags/such-questions/>such questions</a></span></p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>963 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>4040-10-04 11:42</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/posts/aave/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
