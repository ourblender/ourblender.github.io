Permissionless blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum unfortunately are not private. The best you get is pseudonymity, which is not equivalent to anonymity. Many existing privacy solutions have been proposed, and they could be divided into two types of solutions:</p><ol><li>&ldquo;Add-on privacy&rdquo; for non-private blockchains. Real-world examples are Tornado Cash, Zether, etc.</li><li>&ldquo;Private-by-design&rdquo; blockchains, e.g. Monero, ZCash, etc.</li></ol><p>Add-on privacy solutions have the advantage of being surrounded by a significant userbase on their underlying blockchain. At the same time, they have the disadvantage that they might be more expensive than their private-by-design counterparts. If users aren&rsquo;t careful, their privacy is endangered easily.</p><p><strong>Blender</strong> is an add-on privacy solution. Blender is a fork of Tornado Cash, a popular mixer that inspired Blender. Blender has three major differences to Tornado Cash:</p><ul><li>Interest-bearing deposits: Blender ETH is added to <strong>Aave</strong> to yield interests. This reduces the opportunity loss of users using the mixer, and hence incentivises users to keep their assets longer in Blender. This behaviour in return increases the privacy properties of Blender for all participating users.</li><li>Gas costs optimization: Blender uses the Poseidon hash function to reduce the gas costs.</li><li>Governance token: Blender introduces the <code>BLND</code> token, which is awared to mixer participants that have deposited coins for at least <code>5</code> days. <code>Blender</code> is a governance token to decentralize Blender&rsquo;s decision making process. Blender&rsquo;s DAO could be used in the future to add new pools, to change the hash function, etc.</li></ul><h2 id=mixer-basics>Mixer Basics</h2><p>In Blender, a user deposits a fixed amount of coins, for example 0.1, 1, 10, 100 or 1000 ETH. Later, the user can withdraw the same amount from the Blender contract to a new address. The Blender system makes sure that the link between the deposit address and the withdraw address is broken, i.e. a blockchain analysis should not show a link between both. Keep in mind that the users have to utilize Blender properly to make sure their privacy isn&rsquo;t violated through other side-channels (gas fee payment from neutral addresses, IP addresses, browser fingerprinting, etc.).</p><h2 id=defi-farming-mixer>DeFi Farming Mixer</h2><p>Blender is a mixer which allows a depositor to collect a reward, if a coin is deposited for at least <code>5</code> days. Note that farming can only be done if by the 5th day there is a new deposit in the pool. After collecting the DeFi farming reward, the user can then withdraw its deposited coin to a new address. Importantly, there is no link between the deposit and the reward address.</p><p>The reward for mixing coins for at least <code>5</code> days is paid in <code>BLND</code> tokens. We refer to the upcoming post about the token economics for the full details on the <code>BLND</code> token.</p><h3 id=blender--aave--->Blender + Aave = 🥰</h3><p>In addition to the potential to receive a token reward, users that deposit into Blender also earn interests on their deposits. The interests are granted through Aave, where user deposits are integrated. While this increases the return, it also adds a layer of risk due to possible liquidations at Aave.</p><h2 id=source-code>Source Code</h2><p>You can find the complete source-code on Github: <a href=https://github.com/ourblender/ourblender.github.io>https://github.com/ourblender/ourblender.github.io</a>. The contracts are verified and open source on Etherscan.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=tags/mixer/>Mixer</a></span>
