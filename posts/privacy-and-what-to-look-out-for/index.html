Many people have already warned us about global surveillance by state actors, and are risking their lives for us. Online business models are publicly known to track meticiously their users, as a means of generating revenue.</p><p>This is by no means meant to be an exhaustive guide on how to protect your privacy, as its preferrable for you to find extensive resources that have done so very well.</p><p>Just keep in mind to use privacy protecting techniques, on all relevant layers, the hardware, network and application layer.</p><p>On the network layer, you may want to use an onion router (Tor), multiple VPNs, different SSH tunnels, public WiFis or other. When using public WiFi you will want to change your WiFi&rsquo;s MAC address, which you can conveniently do with <code>ipconfig</code> on Unix (be careful about non-persistent settings). Use a clean OS installation whenever possible.</p><p>On your browser side, you will want to not store history, links, caches, cookies, local storage etc.</p><p>On the application layer, your Ethereum address may leak information. Be aware with which website you want to share your Ethereum address. Be aware of Infura, and other centralized blockchain services, they can observe which contract states you&rsquo;re after, and this again, is leaking side channel information. Deploy your own Ethereum full node and point your MetaMask to it.</p><p>Finally a word on Blender&rsquo;s anonymity set. If you care about the best privacy, it&rsquo;s likely best you use the pool with the most deposits. Make sure to never pay gas from and address that is linkable to a deposit address. Use relayers if you can, and protect your network layer information while accessing them. Once you&rsquo;ve withdrawn assets, be careful of how you intertwine multiple withdrawals, as this might leak again more information.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=tags/side-channel/>side-channel</a></span>
